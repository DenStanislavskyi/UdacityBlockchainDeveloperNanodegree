Luck ERC20 Token folder contains project in which:
I created ERC-20 token Using OpenZeppelin, a library of Ethereum smart contracts, to create tokens.
Used Truffle to compile and deploy the token contract to a locally running ethereum network.
Used Infura and Truffle to deploy the token contract to the Ropsten Public Test Network.
Once the contract is deployed on Ropsten, found the deployed token on Etherscan.
Then, used Metamask to import this token.
Finally, sent the token to any ethereum address using Metamask.
